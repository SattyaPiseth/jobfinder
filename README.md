## Best Practices
- **Component Reusability**: Break down UI elements into reusable components for better code maintainability.
- **State Management**: Utilize Redux Toolkit for managing complex application state, with well-defined slices for each feature.
- **Performance Optimization**: Vite's fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) ensures a smooth development experience. Use React hooks and lazy loading to optimize component rendering.
- **Responsive Design**: Implement responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS and follow mobile-first design principles.
- **Testing**: Ensure the application is well-tested with unit and integration tests.
